- Captures screenshots of the entire app screen.
- Option to exclude hidden elements from the screenshot.
- Supports hover effects and responsive design.

## Installation

1. **Download the Component:**
   - Clone or download the component from the repository.

2. **Import the Component into PowerApps:**
   - Navigate to the PowerApps portal.
   - Open your app in edit mode.
   - Select **Insert > Custom > Import Component**.
   - Import the Screenshot Component.

3. **Add the Component to Your App:**
   - Drag and drop the component onto your desired screen.

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. **Add the Screenshot Button:**
   - Drag the Screenshot Component to your desired screen.

2. **Customize the Button:**
   - Use the properties pane to customize the buttonâ€™s appearance, including text, color, size, font, and more.

### Advanced Setup

1. **Hiding Elements Before Taking a Screenshot:**
   - If you want to exclude certain elements (e.g., panels, groups, controls) from the screenshot, you can hide them before triggering the screenshot.

   Example:

   - **Step 1:** Add a button (e.g., "Hide Elements") and set its `OnSelect` property to hide the elements.
   - **Step 2:** Add the Screenshot Button and set its `OnSelect` property to capture the screenshot.
   - **Step 3:** Ensure that the elements remain hidden while the screenshot is captured.

   ```powerapps
   // On the "Hide Elements" button
   Set(variable, false);

   // On the Screenshot button
   Set(varScreenshot, ScreenshotComponent1.screenshot);
   ```

   - **Step 4:** After capturing the screenshot, you can set the elements to visible again if needed.

2. **Handling Output:**
   - The screenshot is returned as a base64 string. You can use this output to send the screenshot via email, save it to a data source, or display it in an Image control within PowerApps.

   Example:
   ```powerapps
   Set(varScreenshotImage, ScreenshotComponent1.screenshot);
   ```
